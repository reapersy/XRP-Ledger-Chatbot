The `config.rs` file is part of the Clockwork project and is responsible for managing the configuration settings of the application. It defines the `Config` struct, `ConfigSettings` struct, and the `ConfigAccount` trait, which are used to store and manipulate the configuration settings.

1. `SEED_CONFIG`: A constant byte slice that represents the seed for generating the program address for the `Config` account.

2. `Config` struct: This struct contains four public fields of type `Pubkey` - `admin`, `epoch_thread`, `hasher_thread`, and `mint`. These fields store the public keys for the admin, epoch thread, hasher thread, and mint, respectively. The struct also has an associated function `pubkey()` that returns the program address for the `Config` account.

3. `ConfigSettings` struct: This struct is similar to the `Config` struct, containing the same fields - `admin`, `epoch_thread`, `hasher_thread`, and `mint`. It derives the `AnchorSerialize` and `AnchorDeserialize` traits, which allow it to be serialized and deserialized for storage and
