The `autodoc/solana/poh/benches` folder contains benchmark tests for the Proof of History (PoH) service in the Solana blockchain. PoH is a crucial component of the Solana blockchain, responsible for generating a verifiable, time-ordered sequence of hashes that establish consensus on the state of the blockchain. The benchmarks in this folder help developers measure the performance of PoH hash generation and verification, and identify areas for optimization.

In `poh.rs`, there are four benchmark tests that focus on the performance of PoH hash generation:

1. `bench_poh_hash`: Measures the performance of the PoH ha
