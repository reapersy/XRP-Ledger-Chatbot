The `Home` folder located at `autodoc/solana/docs/src/icons/duotone-icons/Home` contains the source code and assets for the duotone home icons used within the Solana project. Duotone icons are a type of icon that uses two colors to create a visually appealing and easily recognizable design. These icons are typically used for navigation, buttons, and other user interface elements.

## Files

Here's a brief overview of the files in this folder:

1. `Home.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for rendering the Home icon as a React component. It imports the necessary dependencies, defines the `Home` component, and exports it for use in other parts of the project. The `Home` component accepts standard React props, such as `className` and `style`, allowing developers to customize the appearance and behavior of the icon.

SVG is a widely supported vector image format that can be easily scaled and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript. The `Home.svg` file is used as a source for the `Home.js` React component, ensuring that the icon is rendered correctly and efficiently.

## Usage
