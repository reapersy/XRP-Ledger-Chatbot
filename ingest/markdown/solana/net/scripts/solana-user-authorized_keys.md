The `solana-user-authorized_keys.sh` script is responsible for managing the public keys of users who should be granted access to all testnets and datacenter nodes in the Solana project. This script is used to maintain a list of authorized users and their corresponding public keys, which are used for secure access to the project's resources.

The script contains two arrays, `SOLANA_USERS` and `SOLANA_PUBKEYS`, which store the usernames and their corresponding public keys, respectively. To add a new user to the list, the following steps are performed:

1. Generate a new key pair using `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id-solana-testnet`.
2. Add an entry to `SOLANA_USERS` with the new username.
3. Add an entry to `SOLANA_PUBKEYS` with the contents of the newly generated public key file (`~/.ssh/id-solana-testnet.pub`).

If a user needs multiple keys associated with their username, their username should be added to `SOLANA_USERS` once per key, and each key should be added to `SOLANA_PUBKEYS`.

For example, the script contains the following entries for the user 'trent':

```bash
SOLANA_USERS+=('trent')
SOLANA_PUBKEYS+=('ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEZC/APgZTM1Y/EfNnCHr+BQN+SN4KWfpyGkwMg+nXdC trent@fry')
SOLANA_USERS+=('trent')
SOLANA_PUBKEYS+=('ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDgdbzGLiv9vGo3yaJGzxO3Q2/w5TS4Km2sFGQFWGFIJ trent@farnsworth')
```

In this case, the user 'trent' has two public keys associated with their account, allowing them to access the project's resources using either key.

This script is an essential part of the Solana project's security infrastruct
