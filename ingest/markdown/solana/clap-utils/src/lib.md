The code in this file provides utility functions and modules for working with command-line arguments and other common tasks in the Solana project. 

The `ArgConstant` struct defines a constant value for a command-line argument, including its long name, short name, and help text. This can be used to define arguments for a `clap` app, which is a popular Rust library for building command-line interfaces. 

The `DisplayError` struct is an error type that can be used to forward errors out of the `main()` function of a `clap` app while still allowing them to be formatted using the `Display` trait. This can be useful for providing more user-friendly error messages when running command-line tools. 

The remaining modules in the file provide various utility functions for working with Solana-specific concepts, such as computing the unit price of a token, handling fee payment, parsing input data, validating input data, working with keypairs, and handling memos and nonces. These modules can be used throughout the Solana project to simplify common tasks and ensure consistency across different components. 

For example, the `keypair` module provides functions for generating and loading keypairs, which are used to sign transactions and interact with the Solana blockchain. Here is an
