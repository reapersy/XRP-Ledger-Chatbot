The `constants.h` file in the Solana project defines two constants, `HEAP_START_ADDRESS` and `HEAP_LENGTH`, which specify the start virtual address and length of a memory region provided by the Solana runtime. This memory region is available to programs and can be used for heap operations using the `sol_calloc` and `sol_free` built-in functions. 

Programs can also choose to implement their own heap directly on top of this memory region. However, if a program chooses to do so, they should not call the built-in heap functions as they will conflict with the program's own implementation. 

The purpose of these constants is to provide a fixed memory region that programs can use for heap operations or implement their own heap on top of. By defining these constants, the Solana project ensures that programs have access to a consistent memory region for heap operations, which can help with memory management and allocation. 

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in a program:

```
#include <sol/constants.h>

int main() {
  // Allocate memory from the Solana heap
  void* ptr = sol_calloc(1, sizeof(int));

  // Implement a custom heap on top of the Solana memory region
  uint64_t heap_start = HEAP_START_ADDRESS;
  uint64_t heap_length = HEAP_LENGTH;
  // ... implement custom heap ...
  
  // Free memory allocated from the Solana heap
  sol_free(ptr);

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program first allocates memory from the Solana heap using the `sol_calloc` function. It then implements a custom heap on top of the Solana memory region using the `HEAP_START_ADDRESS` and `HEAP_LENGTH` constants. Finally, it frees the memory allocated from the Solana heap using the `sol_free` function.
