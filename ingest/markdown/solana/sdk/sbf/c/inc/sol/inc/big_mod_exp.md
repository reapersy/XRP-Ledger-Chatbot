The code in `big_mod_exp.inc` is a system call for performing big integer modular exponentiation in the Solana project. This system call is used to calculate the result of a base raised to a power, modulo a given modulus. The function takes in two parameters: a pointer to a `BigModExpParam` struct and a 32-byte array to hold the result. The `BigModExpParam` struct likely contains the base, exponent, and modulus values needed for the calculation.

The purpose of this system call is to provide a way for Solana programs to perform complex cryptographic operations that require bi
