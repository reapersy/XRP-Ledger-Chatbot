## Solana SHA System Call

The `sha.h` file is a header file that contains the declaration of the `sol_sha256` function. This function is used to generate a SHA-256 hash of an array of byte arrays. The SHA-256 hash is a cryptographic hash function that generates a fixed-size output (32 bytes) from an input of arbitrary size. The hash function is designed to be computationally expensive to reverse, making it suitable for use in digital signatures, password storage, and other applications where data integrity is critical.

The `sol_sha256` function takes three arguments: an array of byte arrays (`SolBytes`), t
