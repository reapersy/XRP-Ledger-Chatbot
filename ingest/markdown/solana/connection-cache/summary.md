The `connection-cache` module in the Solana project is responsible for managing client connections to the Solana network. It provides a cache of connections that can be reused by clients, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections and improving performance.

The module contains several files, including `client_connection.rs`, `connection_cache.rs`, and `connection_cache_stats.rs`. The `client_connection.rs` file defines a `ClientConnection` trait that outlines methods for sending data synchronously and asynchronously. The `connection_cache.rs` file defines a `ConnectionCache` struct that maintains a map of connections to remote addresses and provides methods to create new connections, add connections to the pool, and get connections from the pool. The `connection_cache_stats.rs` file defines a `ConnectionCacheStats` struct that is used to track statistics related to the connection cache, such as the number of connections in the pool and the number of connections that have been created.

The `nonblocking` subfolder contains code for creating non-blocking TCP connections, which can be used to improve performance by allowing multi
