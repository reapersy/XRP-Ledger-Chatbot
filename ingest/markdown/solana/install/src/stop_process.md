The `stop_process.rs` file contains code that is responsible for stopping a running process. The code is platform-specific, with different implementations for Windows and non-Windows systems.

The `kill_process` function takes a mutable reference to a `Child` process and attempts to kill it. If the process is successfully killed, the function waits for the process to exit. If the process has already exited, the function prints a message to the console. The function returns a `Result` with an empty `Ok` value if the operation is successful, or an `io::Error` if an error occurs.

The `stop_process` function is the main entry point for stopping a process. On Windows systems, it simply calls the `kill_process` function. On non-Windows systems, it uses the `nix` library to send a `SIGINT` signal to the process, which is a request for the process to terminate. The function then waits for the process to exit, with a timeout of 5 seconds. If the process does not exit within the timeout period, the function calls `kill_process` to forcefully terminate the process. If an error occurs during the process termination, the function returns an `io::Error`.
