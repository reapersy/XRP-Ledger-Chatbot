The `next_slots_iterator.rs` file contains the implementation of the `NextSlotsIterator` struct and its associated methods. This struct is used to iterate over the next slots in a blockstore given a starting slot. 

The `NextSlotsIterator` struct has two fields: `pending_slots` and `blockstore`. `pending_slots` is a vector of `Slot` types that contains the slots that are yet to be processed. `blockstore` is a reference to a `Blockstore` instance that is used to retrieve the metadata for each slot.

The `NextSlotsIterator` struct has an associated `new` method that takes a starting slot and a reference to a `Blockstore` instance and returns a new `NextSlotsIterator` instance. The `pending_slots` field of the new instance is initialized with a vector containing the starting slot.

The `NextSlotsIterator` struct implements the `Iterator` trait, which requires the implem
