The `autodoc/solana/program-runtime` folder contains essential modules for executing smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. These modules ensure efficient and secure execution of smart contracts within the Solana program runtime.

For example, the `accounts_data_meter.rs` module tracks and meters the available accounts data space during program runtime. It ensures that the accounts data space does not exceed the maximum allowed size and monitors the amount of available space. Developers can use the `AccountsDataMeter` struct to create a new instance with an initial amount of accounts data space used and adjust the space used by accounts data.

```rust
let mut accounts_data_meter = AccountsDataMeter::new(used_space, max_space);
accounts_data_meter.adjust_space_used(new_space);
```

The `executor_cache.rs` module defines a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache for storing executors of Solana programs. This cache improves the performance of the Solana runtime by reducing the need to load executors from the database and evicting the least frequently used ones when the cache reaches its capacity. The `BankExecutorCache` struct can be used to add, get, and remove executors from the cache.

```rust
let mut executor_cache = BankExecutorCache::new(capacity);
executor_cache.add(program_id, executor);
let executor = executor_cache.get(&program_id);
executor_cache.remove(&program_id);
```

The `log_collector.rs` module provides a way to collect log messages and limit their size. The `LogCollector` struct collects log messages generated by smart contracts and stores them in a buffer, which can be retrieved and processed by downstream consumers of pr
