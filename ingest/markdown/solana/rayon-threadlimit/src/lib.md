The code in `lib.rs` is responsible for limiting the number of threads used by the Rayon thread pool in the Solana project. Rayon is a parallel computing library that allows for easy parallelization of code by abstracting away the details of thread creation and management. However, if not properly configured, Rayon can use too many threads and hog CPU resources, leading to poor performance.

To address this issue, the code in `lib.rs` uses the `lazy_static` macro to define a global static variable called `MAX_RAYON_THREADS`. This variable is initialized using the `env::var` function to read the value of an environment variable called `SOLANA_RAYON_THREADS`. If this environment va
